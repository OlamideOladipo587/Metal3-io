# Metal3-io

This is a landing page for the Metal3-io project as part of my outreachy contribution. The website contains an overview of the Metal3-io project, it's goals and mission, the components of the Metal3-io project, how to use Metal3-io and how you can be a part of the community. I personally find this project intruiging and it's mission is to provide a Kubernetes-native way of managing bare metal infrastructure, which makes it as easy as managing virtualized infrastructure.
Here is a link to the landing page I created https://olamideoladipo587.github.io/Metal3-io/
